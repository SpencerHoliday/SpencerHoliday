- 👋 Hi, I’m Spencer.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code so that I can have more adventures with my kids. I want them to see that we never stop learning and trying new things!
- 🌱 I learned beginner web development over 20 years ago when I was a writer, filmmaker, and photographer. Since then, I've also been a secondary science teacher, and a homeschool parent. Now my logic and creative past are coming together again to learn coding!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that make the world a more positive place.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a great fondness for dinosaurs and penguins.
